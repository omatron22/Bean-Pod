Welcome to BeanPod, a super simple chat app designed for everyone: After feeling overwhelmed with huge chat apps, we wanted to make a web private chat application that's super easy to use. We only have two small, but powerful screens handling everything from messaging to themes to image scaling. Using the power of Ant Design and Firebase, we made something super easy and super powerful.
